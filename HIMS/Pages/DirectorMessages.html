                        <p>
                            Hayatabad Institute of Medical Sciences, is not just another attempt to make money or achieve cheap fame. It's a mission to make a dent into the dilapidated health care system, via quality education and inculcation of rich local traditions and values like care, love and respect for all living humanity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At HIMS, we believe that the services of Allied Medical Professionals are essential for a sound efficient & effective health care system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, on one hand, in Pakistan the Allied Health Professionals are being constantly ignored by the policy makers as well as the medical fraternity, on the other end very few if any institution exists, where they can be educated, trained and groomed for the challenges of our times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HIMS, therefore, take it as a challenge to produce Allied Health Care Professionals (with a focus on Nursing) who are not only equipped with the cutting-edge academic background and hands on experience, they are also being sensitized to the growing needs of nuclear family in the future to come.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the moment we are going to start with, embarking upon 3 to 5 programs including BSN, but we intend to add many more programs, with passage of time, however we are going to make Nursing as our King Pin and eventually start MSN even Ph.D. Programs in Nursing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We believe in thinking "Global and acting local" which means that we will try to establish contacts with excellent Nursing programs around the World, work out mutually beneficial joint ventures with them, so that our Nursing graduates are exposed to modern technologies and innovative ideas, which will revolutionize Nursing care in Pakistan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At HIMS, we believe that proper training and education of health workers in Pakistan will not only enable our health care system to meet the challenges of the 21st century Pakistan, it will also create ample opportunities for our youth to use their services & skills earning much needed foreign exchange for our country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HIMS, truly has the potential to change the landscape of Allied Health Professional outlook, altogether as almost 99% of the Medical & Para Medical Institutions are just making money and glittering the market with ill trained, Health Care workers with no vision or mission in sight.
